# Agent Rules

This repository contains my personal agent rules, guidelines, and configuration files for building, maintaining, and improving AI agents and related workflows.

## Purpose
This project serves as a central place to document and refine the rules, conventions, and best practices I use when developing or interacting with AI agents. It is intended for personal reference, experimentation, and continuous self-improvement.
